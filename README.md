# CMB-S4 Fisher Forecast for Primordial non-Gaussianity

In this project, the variance in the amplitude of non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ is computed for three bispectrum templates: local, equilateral, and orthogonal. The forecast includes the updated noise values for CMB-S4 (https://cmb-s4.org/) as well as the contribution from ISW-Lensing. KSW estimators were used to compute the bispectra.

To run the code, the following steps should be followed:

1) The package requirements should be met by running the following command in a Python 3.11 virtual environment (while in the directory of the project):

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

2) CAMB data is generated by running CAMB_Data/CAMB_Computation.py

3) The sampling of the comoving coordinate r is calculated by running /AlphaBetaGammaDelta_Computation/r_sampling.py

4) The alpha, beta, gamma, and delta functions are computed by running /AlphaBetaGammaDelta_Computation/AlphaBetaGammaDelta.py

5) The noise for Temperature and E-Mode polarization is calculated by running /Noise_Calculation/Noise_Calculation.py

6) To compute the Fisher elements, a C-extension has to be created from /Compute_Fisher/Compute_Fisher.pyx . This is done by running the following command in the directory of the .pyx file:

$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

7) The actual calculation is done by running /Compute_Fisher/Fisher_Calculation_Script.py

8) The variance and ISW-Lensing bias is computed by running /Variance/Variance.py

IMPORTANT NOTE: All python scripts include a variable named 'PATH'. This should be set to the path of the project on the PC. The code will not work otherwise.
