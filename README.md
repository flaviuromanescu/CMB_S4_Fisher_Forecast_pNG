# CMB-S4 Fisher Forecast for Primordial non-Gaussianity

In this project, the variance in the amplitude of non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ is computed for three bispectrum templates: local, equilateral, and orthogonal. The forecast includes the updated noise values for CMB-S4 (https://cmb-s4.org/) as well as contribution from ISW-Lensing.
